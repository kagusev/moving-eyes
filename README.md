<h1> Moving Eyes </h1>


## Description:
  This is learning exercise - "Moving Eyes" I built while learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Eye balls are moving following the cursor move. In addition to reqired features I added following functionality: an alert asking not to poke in the eye is shown if user click on eye balls.  

## How to Run: 
  Copy the project on local machine and use IDE of your choise that incudes a web server. Deploy the index.html. Move the cursor around. Click eye ball to invoke an alert.

## Roadmap for future improvement:
  I'm planning to implement a different eye movement algorithm so in cases when cursor is between the eyes both eyes would continue follow the cursor.
